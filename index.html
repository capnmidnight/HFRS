Melody was a team player and a pleasure to work with.</p>

          <p>AASP strives to create a close community of Advancement Services professionals, but for Melody Allen McBeth and Tammy Armstrong, the industry truly is a family affair. Melody, Director of Development Information Systems and Services and Interim Director of Gift Administration at The Children's Hospital Foundation, and her daughter Tammy, Director of Analytics at Oregon Episcopal School, share a passion for analytics and child welfare. Though their unique career paths brought them to different areas of the nonprofit sector, the two never run out of stories to share. Whether it's working out puzzling Crystal Reports over the phone or recapping sessions from the latest annual Summit, Melody and Tammy always find a resource in each other's encouragement and expertise&hellip;</p>
