She looks beneath the surface to determine both digital and human solutions to inconsistencies. We have made great strides in cleaning up our data base and utilizing its capabilities under her guidance and our donor information services area is working better than ever.

She knew it was important to educate leadership and the staff on processes for entering and looking at data that will make fundraising more successful for the Foundation. Melody was a team player and a pleasure to work with.
