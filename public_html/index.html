            <p>Melody was great to work with at Children's National. She understood our fundraising database and the
              Special Events team needs to get the information (data about individuals) quickly, in the right format and
              correct. She knew it was important to educate leadership and the staff on processes for entering and looking at
              data that will make fundraising more successful for the Foundation. Melody was a team player and a pleasure

              Page7
              timely manner. She also adds a great deal to office morale. During her tenure at Mercersburg she also earned

          <p>Virtual Worlds are blending into our habitable universe and expanding future possibilities within our everyday lives.  Our ability to connect and share ideas, dreams and accomplishments is unprecedented. Virtual worlds are no longer just branded escapist experiences, but they are augmenting our human powers of creativity, passion and the imagination. We are getting ready to launch into the next “giant leap” into the empowered human experience&hellip;</p>

          <p>I see this on the entrepreneurial-bent message boards across the internet. A guy in a suit comes on and complains they can't find a programmer to build their idea "for equity," or what people who didn't go to MBA school call "for free."&hellip;</p>

          <p>Read any blog post from any self-espoused entrepreneurship guru and they will tell you that the secret to success is something called Passion. The only way you're going to get through the slog, the long hours, and the naysayers is to be working on something that excites you&hellip;</p>

            <small>(2014-12-09)</small>
          </cite>
          <p>Some friends of mine had recently started a discussion of starting a study group to learn to program. The discussion fell to what programming language to learn, and I started to write a reply, but it got a bit long. The TL;DR is: if you want to make programming your career, your first language largely doesn't matter. But if you want to get a certain job done, then you're likely extremely restricted on what you should use&hellip;</p>

            <small>(2014-10-17)</small>
          </cite>
          <p>I recently received a very generous job offer from a rather prestigious company. There is a chance someone in the company is reading this, because I didn't even apply; they contacted me through LinkedIn. To say that I was honored to even receive a cold contact from such a company is an understatement. "Flabbergasted" is a much more appropriate term&hellip;</p>
