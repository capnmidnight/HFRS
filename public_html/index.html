                correct. She knew it was important to educate leadership and the staff on processes for entering and looking at

                expected deliverables. She has my highest recommendation!</p>

                Page7
                timely manner. She also adds a great deal to office morale. During her tenure at Mercersburg she also earned

              <p>Simply put, Sean is one of the most creative problem solvers I have ever worked with. At his core, Sean embodies the engineering spirit start up companies dream of--he works till the job is finished and usually finds a better way to do something than was previously done in the process. He is talented, personable, and team-oriented; in short, Sean is the total package!</p>

                <h4>The Virtual World Society quotes Sean on Virtual Reality</h4>
                <p>I think about creating an externally-minimal, internally-maximal lifestyle through VR/AR. I think about how we're going to save the first manned mission to Mars from death from boredom with VR. Can we create an experience of social interaction, work, exercise, entertainment, etc. that is rich enough to sustain a person's creativity on a long-range trip to another planet? Can we create a BioDome for the mind?</p>
